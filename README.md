# Audio Angel v1.1

![Audio Angel's main window: four input strips (Vocal Mic, Yamaha Piano, Mac / iPad, Zoom), each with five effects, and two output strips (Teacher, Student)](docs/screenshot.png)

<sub>The main window on the author's lesson rig: a Focusrite interface, a Yamaha digital
piano, browser/iPad sound and the Zoom call, sent to the teacher's headphones and to
the student. Rendered by the app itself (`--snapshot --demo`) with every device
switched on.</sub>

A small Mac app that routes audio for lessons over Zoom. It gathers your **mic**
(USB interface), your **piano** (Yamaha USB), **browser music** and **the Zoom
call** into input strips, and sends each of them wherever you choose: **to Zoom**,
to your **headphones**, or anything else.

Created by Philip Warda with the instrumental help of Claude Opus 5.0.

**Why it exists.** Teaching piano over Zoom means juggling a mic, a digital piano,
backing tracks in the browser and the call itself, and macOS has no way to mix them
and hand the result to Zoom. Audio Angel is that missing mixing desk: low latency,
built to stay up for a whole lesson, and simple enough to set once and forget.

**Requirements:** macOS 13 Ventura or later, the free
[BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) loopback driver, and
Apple's Command Line Tools to build it (no Xcode needed).

---

## First time

**1. Install the loopback devices.** macOS can't hand one app's sound to another by
itself, so we use BlackHole (free, open source): three virtual "cables".

```bash
brew install blackhole-2ch blackhole-16ch blackhole-64ch
```

Then log out and back in (or restart) so macOS picks them up. The number in each
name is its channel count; Audio Angel only uses channels 1+2 of each, so to us
they are just three separate cables.

**2. Get the code and build the app.** Only Apple's Command Line Tools are needed,
not Xcode (`xcode-select --install` if you don't have them).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philpiano/audio-angel.git
cd audio-angel
./build.sh
```

That runs the audio engine's tests, then makes `build/Audio Angel.app`. Drag it to
Applications if you like.

**3. Open it** and allow microphone access when macOS asks. Without that, every
input is silent. macOS treats all audio inputs as "microphone", the loopbacks too.
The builds are signed ad hoc, so macOS may ask again after a rebuild.

---

## The three cables

| Device          | Who writes into it                 | Who listens              | Strip in Audio Angel  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| BlackHole 2ch   | Audio Angel                        | Zoom (as its microphone) | output **Student**    |
| BlackHole 16ch  | Zoom (as its speaker)              | Audio Angel              | input **Zoom**        |
| BlackHole 64ch  | The Mac (set as the system output) | Audio Angel              | input **Mac / Browser** |

**In Zoom › Settings › Audio**
- Microphone: **BlackHole 2ch**
- Speaker: **BlackHole 16ch**
- Turn on **Original sound for musicians** in the settings, and in the meeting.
  Otherwise Zoom's noise suppression chews up the piano.
- Untick **Automatically adjust microphone volume**.

**The Mac's output** goes to **BlackHole 64ch** (Settings › "Send Mac sound to…").
From then on, anything the Mac plays (Chrome, YouTube, Spotify) arrives in the
**Mac / Browser** input.

**iPad sound** reaches the Mac only through the app that captures the iPad (OBS).
In OBS set **Settings › Audio › Advanced › Monitoring Device** to **BlackHole
64ch** and the iPad source's monitoring to **Monitor and Output**; it then arrives
in the same **Mac / Browser** input.

Never send the **Zoom** input to the output that feeds Zoom: your student would
hear themselves.

---

## Using it

Every strip reads top to bottom, the way sound flows.

**Input strips**
- **Source:** the device and its channels (mono, or a stereo pair).
- **Effects**, in signal order. Each has an on/off button and an amount knob
  beside it. 100% is the effect as designed and sits where a send's 0 dB does;
  drag up or down (0–150%), double-click for 100%, right-click for 120 / 100 / 80%.
  - **Low-cut** (on by default): removes rumble below 80 Hz (12 dB/octave), the
    standard mixing-desk low-cut. It slightly softens the piano's lowest octave;
    turn it off on the Piano strip if you miss that weight. The amount moves the
    cutoff (120% is 96 Hz).
  - **Noise gate** (on by default): silences a steady background noise (a fan,
    hiss, hum) while speech, piano and every sudden sound pass straight through at
    full level. It learns the room's noise by itself from any pause of a few
    seconds, and playing never fools it into cutting soft passages. The amount sets
    how strict it is: above 100% for a noisier room, below to let more through.
  - **Auto level** (on by default): so you don't have to ride the volume. When
    the student drops well below their normal level it brings them back up, and
    when they jump back up it catches the jump before it reaches you. Its light
    turns yellow while it's lifting a quiet passage and red while it's capping a
    jump. It learns
    their normal level while they play and holds it through pauses, so silence
    never pumps up the hiss. The amount sets how strongly it acts; at 0% it does
    nothing.
  - **Compress** (on by default): a gentle leveller (2:1 above −24 dBFS, soft knee,
    +2 dB make-up). Normal speech is left about where it was, shouts come down,
    whispers come up 2 dB. Its light turns yellow while it's working. The amount
    sets how strongly it acts.
  - **Limiter** (on by default): a safety net at −1 dBFS. Silent until a peak would
    overload; its light turns orange while it's catching one. Above 100% the
    ceiling drops (150% is −6 dBFS); below, some of a peak gets through.
- **Fader** with its meter, then two boxes: the **level** in dB and the **peak**.
  Click the level to type an exact value (`-6`, `+3.5`, `-inf`); right-click for
  +5 / 0 / −5 dB. The peak box holds the loudest moment since you last clicked it,
  and turns red if that moment reached full scale, so a clip is still showing when
  you come back to the window. **M** mutes.
- **Send:** one button per output. Click to send this input there; the knob beside
  it sets how much (drag up or down, double-click for 0 dB). A send that would feed
  a loopback back into itself is blocked and shows ⚠.

**Output strips**
- **Source:** the name inputs send to. It's the first word of the output's name
  ("Teacher Headphones" → **Teacher**); double-click to rename it. Green when
  something is being sent here; hover to see what.
- **Limiter** (on by default): a final −1 dBFS safety net on everything sent here,
  for when a few boosted inputs add up.
- **Fader**, **level**, **peak**, **M**, then **Output:** the device it plays on.

**Everywhere**
- The dot next to a strip's name: green = connected, orange = device unplugged (it
  reconnects on its own), red = that device doesn't have those channels.
- **⋯** on a strip moves it left or right, or removes it.
- The window is always exactly the size of the desk, status bar included when it's
  shown, and follows it when you switch modes or add a strip. Squeeze it as small
  as you like and the desk scrolls. Closing it **doesn't stop the audio**;
  the waveform icon in the menu bar reopens it or quits.
- **View › Compact Mode** switches to a tight layout for teaching with other windows
  open: narrower strips, smaller controls, and M sharing a row with the level and
  peak. **View › Status Bar** hides the bar along the top; dropouts and clips are
  still counted and show again when it's back. Both are remembered, and Settings
  stays on ⌘, either way.
- Everything is saved automatically.

**The status bar**
- **≈ ms:** the delay through Audio Angel. Zoom adds its own on top.
- **⚠** next to the status: something needs attention, usually a device that isn't
  connected. Click it to read what.
- **ⓘ**: good to know, nothing to do. For example, the Yamaha's USB audio only runs
  at 44.1 kHz, so macOS converts it to 48 kHz on the way in.
- **Dropouts:** times the Mac couldn't prepare audio in time and a tiny click got
  through. An odd one is harmless; if it climbs while you play, raise the buffer
  size. The first two seconds after a start aren't counted.
- **Clipped:** times an output went over full scale and the final safety stage
  caught it — usually two loud sources adding up. Turn that output down a little.
- Click a counter to clear it; **↻** restarts the engine and clears both.
- **⚙ Settings** (⌘,): sample rate (**keep 48 kHz**, what Zoom uses), buffer size
  (**128** is a good start), the clock device, and the setup checklist. An orange
  dot on the gear means something in the checklist needs attention.

## How it works

**One clock, one callback.** Audio Angel builds a hidden, private *aggregate device*
out of every device you've assigned. Core Audio keeps them all in step (your USB
interface is the master clock; the others are drift-corrected against it). Then
one audio callback sees every input and every output at the same moment. Routing
is a plain matrix mix: no buffers between devices, no extra delay added.

**The audio thread is plain C** (`Sources/RouterCore`). It never allocates memory,
takes a lock, or calls into Swift. Each input runs low-cut → noise gate → auto
level → compress (with the fader) → limiter, and each output a limiter; none of it
adds latency, and every effect is crossfaded when switched so nothing clicks. The UI changes levels through lock-free atomics, smoothed over
~10 ms. A soft safety stage on every output means nothing leaves the app above full
scale.

**The rest is Swift / SwiftUI** (`Sources/AudioAngel`):

| File                    | What it does |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| `EngineController.swift`| Builds the aggregate device, maps strips to channels, and heals itself (below). |
| `RouterModel.swift`     | App state, saving, meters at 30 fps. |
| `Mixer.swift`           | The strips: sources, effects, faders, sends, outputs. |
| `Views.swift`           | The window, status bar, and Settings. |
| `RouterConfig.swift`    | Strips and sends as saved, and the first-launch layout guessed from device names. |
| `CoreAudioUtils.swift`  | Typed wrappers for the Core Audio property API. |
| `Diagnostics.swift`     | Command-line checks (below). |

### Built to stay up

- **Plug and unplug freely.** The app listens for device changes. When a device it
  needs appears, disappears or changes, it rebuilds the engine automatically. The
  other devices keep their settings, and a missing device just goes quiet until it
  returns.
- **Changing channels doesn't rebuild.** The engine re-points the strips in a few
  milliseconds.
- **Sleep/wake:** it rebuilds after waking, once USB devices are back.
- **Watchdog:** if the audio callback stops for 3 seconds, the engine restarts.
- **If a build fails**, it retries with backoff (2, 4, 8, 15 s…) and says why.
- **If another app changes the sample rate** of a device in use, it puts it back.
- **App Nap is disabled** while it runs, so macOS never throttles the audio.
- The engine's aggregate device is *private*. It disappears when the app quits,
  even if it crashes, so it never clutters your Sound settings.

## Diagnostic log

Turn on **Settings › Diagnostics › Write a diagnostic log** (it's off by default)
and, if the sound ever stops, Audio Angel will have recorded why. Each launch then
writes one log file, **`logs/audio-angel-<date>_<time>.jsonl`** in this project
folder (or `~/Library/Logs/Audio Angel/` if the app lives somewhere else).
**Show log folder** opens it. The newest 60 sessions are kept; the folder is
ignored by git.

It's [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org): one event per line, readable in any text
editor and easy to analyse. Every line has `t` (time, to the millisecond), `s`
(seconds since launch) and `ev` (what happened). The events that explain a gap:

| Event | What it records |
|---|---|
| `rebuild_scheduled` | The engine decided to restart, and **the exact trigger** (a device vanished, a sample rate changed, the watchdog, a setting, the ↻ button…) |
| `sample_rate_changed`, `device_alive_changed`, `devices_changed` | Each notification the engine acted on or ignored, with the values it saw and its decision |
| `hal_property` | Every raw change Core Audio reported on the devices in use, whether or not it caused anything |
| `audio_stopped` / `audio_resumed` | When sound stopped, why, and **how long it was silent**, measured on the audio thread's own clock |
| `set_device_rate`, `aggregate_created`, `aggregate_ready`, `engine_started`, `rebuild_failed` | Each step of a restart and how long it took |
| `heartbeat` (every 2 s) | Callbacks on time, the longest gap between them, each strip's peak level and any stretch of exact digital silence, clips, dropouts |
| `overload`, `watchdog_no_callbacks` | Missed audio deadlines and stalls |
| `config`, `devices`, `session_start` | Your settings, every device with its rates and latencies, the Mac, other running apps, sleep/wake |

The log holds device names and timings, never audio. Nothing is written from the
audio thread, so recording can't cause a dropout.

## Checks

```bash
./build.sh test                                               # engine tests only (no hardware)
"build/Audio Angel.app/Contents/MacOS/AudioAngel" --list-devices
"build/Audio Angel.app/Contents/MacOS/AudioAngel" --probe      # silent run on the speakers
"build/Audio Angel.app/Contents/MacOS/AudioAngel" --probe --log DIR  # and check the log explains a forced restart
"build/Audio Angel.app/Contents/MacOS/AudioAngel" --snapshot out.png           # the window, as a picture
"build/Audio Angel.app/Contents/MacOS/AudioAngel" --snapshot-settings out.png  # the Settings window
```

The engine tests cover routing, mixing, gain, mute, meters, peak hold, garbage
input, bad channel maps, and each effect against its specification (the low-cut's
−3 dB point, the compressor's curve, the limiters' ceilings, switching without
clicks). The noise gate and auto level are tested on realistic sound rather than
test tones: room noise, piano-like notes, speech-like bursts, pedalled legato, a fan
switching on, pauses, and a student dropping to 10% and jumping back.

`--probe` builds a real engine on the built-in speakers (output only: silent, and no
microphone prompt). It checks that callbacks arrive at the right rate, rebuilds at a
new buffer size, confirms the engine stays still when nothing changes, and confirms
nothing is left behind. With `--log DIR` it also records a diagnostic log, changes
the speakers' sample rate behind the engine's back (and restores it), and checks
that the log attributes the resulting restart to the rate change and measures the
silence.

## Limits and next steps

- macOS 13 or later, up to 8 inputs and 8 outputs, mono or stereo.
- BlackHole's device names are fixed (2ch / 16ch / 64ch). A later version could
  ship its own virtual devices named "Audio Angel → Zoom" and so on. That's a
  Core Audio driver (AudioServerPlugIn), deliberately not in this version.
- A dedicated iPad input would mean capturing the iPad directly; it may compete
  with OBS for the device, so it needs testing outside a lesson first.
